Murdering unarmed black people may be part of white America's patriotic heritage, but it violates the Constitutional rights of the dead and their loved ones, in the 21st century. On the odd occasion that the courts find the killings unjustified, the police usually keep their jobs and pensions. They get time off with pay and counseling to recover from being a murderer. The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA. I guess killing black children is patriotic for some white folks. They are easier and safer to kill than unarmed black teens and adults. The children almost never fight back.</th>\n",

Teresa and Nicole are very close personal friends. Is it likely Teresa's campaign knew nothing about this post? If not, why hasn't she condemned it, after the fact/this article?\\n\\n2. Has Teresa ever done the very hard work of signing up unorganized workers from a non-union workplace into a union? Represented union members' grievances under a collective bargaining agreement? Negotiated a collective bargaining agreement? Organized a strike? Done anything other than elite, high-level, top-down lobbying of corporate Dems? How much of this non-lobbying work has Nicole done, and for how many years?\\n\\n3. Why is Teresa's campaign paying Christian Sinderman, a politico synonymous with the establishment?\\n\\nAt least Jon Grant worked for a housing justice non-profit, dependent on grassroots organizing and a shoestring budget.</th>\n",
